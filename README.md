### Animated Smiley Faces
There are two versions to this exercise.  
1. The first is per the course instructions and shows sleeping smiley faces waking up and bouncing (on mouse hover) but with inconsistent and stuttering animation startup. 

2. The second (enhanced) version shows my attempt at better color choices and smoother amimation startup. On mouse hover, the 
smiley face opens its eyes and its container expands slightly.  Then on mouse click and hold, it changes to a more saturated color 
and bounces up and down.  Each bouncing face demonstrates different CSS cubic-bezier function parameters.

### CSS Menu Rollover
This exercise uses CSS/HTML (no JavaScript) to create a 4 element horizontal menu with a single drop down menu.  I made a slight modification to the positioning of the submenu (different from the course code) so that the submenu would not disappear when slowly moving the mouse down from the parent menu element (Portfolio) into the submenu.
