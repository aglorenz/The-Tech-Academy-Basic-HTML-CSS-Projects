1) Animated Bouncing Smiley Faces
There are two versions to this exercise.  
a) The first is per the course instructions and shows bouncing smiley faces (on mouse hover) but with inconsistent and 
stuttering animation startup. 

b) The second (enhanced) version shows my attempt at better color choices and smoother amimation startup. On mouse hover, the 
smiley face opens its eyes and its container expands slightly.  Then on mouse click and hold, it changes to a more saturated color 
and bounces up and down.  Each bouncing face demonstrates different cubic-bezier function parameters.
