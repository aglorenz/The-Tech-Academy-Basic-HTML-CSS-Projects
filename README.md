## Small CSS HTML Projects

### Responsive Login Form 10/13/2018
This exercise demonstrates the use of a login form (using login_style.css).  In the second part of the exercise (login_style2.css), @media rule in media queries to style the sheet differently depending on different media types (i.e., screen width of different devices) being used.

### Animate Photo Gallery 10/9/2018
This exercise creates a text overlay on a photo.  The overlay is initially invisible.  Upon mouse hover, the text becomes visible and the photo beneath it becomes slightly zoomed from its center. The text transition is almost immediate and the photo transition is a half second.  With this exercise, I gained more experience using the developer version of Firefox and was able to view real-time results when changing various CSS properties including animations.  Fun!

### CSS Menu Rollover 10/8/2018
This exercise uses CSS/HTML (no JavaScript) to create a 4 element horizontal menu with a single drop down menu.  I made a slight modification to the positioning of the submenu (different from the course code) so that the submenu would not disappear when slowly moving the mouse down from the parent menu element (Portfolio) into the submenu.

### Animated Smiley Faces 10/5/2018
There are two versions to this exercise.  
1. The first is per the course instructions and shows sleeping smiley faces waking up and bouncing (on mouse hover) but with inconsistent and stuttering animation startup. 

2. The second (enhanced) version shows my attempt at better color choices and smoother amimation startup. On mouse hover, the 
smiley face opens its eyes and its container expands slightly.  Then on mouse click and hold, it changes to a more saturated color 
and bounces up and down.  Each bouncing face demonstrates different CSS cubic-bezier function parameters.
